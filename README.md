# SMOTE-over-Sampling
This repository is for MATLAB code for balancing of multiclass data by SMOTE.

This is the MATLAB implementation of Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the unbalanced data. The paper followed for this is https://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.1813.pdf. We have updated this work for multiclass dataset.
